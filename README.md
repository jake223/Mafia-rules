#Live Action Mafia Rules

##Current Moderators

The mods for this game are Ian Clester and Isaac Grosof. You can reach the mods for this game through the forum account ijaacg or iap-2016-mafia-gms@mit.edu.

##Communication

You may communicate with moderators by messaging their account on the mafia forums, sending them an email, or by communicating with them in private. Any method is acceptable, but please send all messages to their joint account/mailing list and not to them individually.

Communication with the Mods is confidential. Do not reveal anything about what the Mods communicate to you, except what you have learned through official game actions. 

The forums at mafia.mit.edu have three sub-forums for this game. The Town Square is for all living players to communicate in. The Mafia Den is for the living mafia and anyone they choose to add. The Graveyard is for the dead players.

Cryptography, anonymous communication, and dead-man switches are not allowed. Public randomness (a coin flip or die roll that everyone can see) is also forbidden. Private randomness ("hey guys, I totally chose this at random") is allowed.

##Evictions

Periodically, the moderators may notify noticeably inactive players about their lack of activity. If such a player does not respond to that notification within 24 hours, they may be removed from the game at the end of the day. Such a death will be indistinguishable from other end-of-day kills other than executions.

##Goals

The Town wins if all mafia are dead. The mafia wins if all townies are dead. If you are currently a townie, your goal is for the town to win. If you are a mafia, your goal is for the mafia to win. If you are a serial killer, your goal is for the mafia to win. Everyone is 100% loyal to their current team, even if they expect to switch teams. **You win with your team; your personal survival does not matter. **

##Kills

Some players can kill another player by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "BANG" or "KABOOM." If this happens to you, you are dead, unless you know otherwise. **Dead players tell no tales. They do not communicate, give general advice to, or make facial expressions towards living players or non-players.** If you died to a "BANG", all of your items now belong to the person who killed you. Try to get the physical representations to them. Also, please let the Mods know who killed you, where, and when. If you killed someone, also please let the Mods know who, where, and when, as well as reporting them on the webapp.

If you are dead, and someone tries to talk to you about game, you must respond with "I can't talk about that." All players (including ghosts) must respond truthfully to inquiries about whether they are alive.

Kills will be announced officially on the forums. If a kill announcement happens within an hour of day end, game will be extended until an hour after the announcement.


##Executions

Each day, each player may cast a vote for a player to execute. You may vote for No Execution. You may make conditional votes (ex: Vote for player X unless there's another kill, otherwise vote for player Y). Mods will count only your latest submission (ex: you voted for sammyluo at 9:07pm, but then voted again for jakob at 9:09pm, you will be counted as voting to execute jakob). At Day End (11 PM), whoever has the most votes is executed, and all votes are cleared. The tiebreaker between players is whoever placed higher on the previous day. If both players had the same number of votes every day of game, all tied players will be executed.

##Alibis

Non-players are not constrained on what they say. They can lie, tell the truth, or choose not to talk about it. However, players should not actively ask non-players to communicate information about what they witness. Telling a non-player to report who killed you counts as a deadman switch, and is not allowed. Likewise, non-players are discouraged from volunteering information to players without being specifically asked. Players can, nevertheless, take the initiative to ask non-players whether they have any information on what happened.

Information created electronically may never be shown to any other player, and other players should never try to look at it. **Never look at another player's screen. Do not show messages of any kind (although you can paraphrase). Most importantly, players should never see other players' forum screens.** It is the responsibility of all players to make sure this does not happen.

##Faking Game Actions

**Do not fake incants. We also ask non-players not to fake game incants. **You are not allowed to not use an incant and make it look like you did (although using an incant and making it look like you didn't is, of course, acceptable). As a reminder, the incants not to fake are:

 - "BANG"
 - "KABOOM"
 - "I TAZE <Name>"
 - "I do not die"
 - "Disarm"
 - "I am an innocent child and I trust you."
 - "I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."

##Town Roles:

###Investigator
Whenever a kill is made, a number of clues spawn equal to the number of Serial Killers plus one. Investigators may visit a kill location to study all clues at that kill location. On each visit to the murder location, the Mods will inform them how many clues they find. Note that Serial Killers can destroy clues (see serial killer section below).

Once per day, an investigator may ask the Mods a question of the form "Did X kill Y?" A single investigator can only make as many total investigations of a player's death as they found clues at that player's murder location upon the first visit.

After studying a kill location, an investigator may return to it to count the clues again, but they wait at least an hour before studying the same kill location. The updated clue count does not add to or detract from the number of investigations the investigator can make.

###Superhero

The superhero has two forms: _Superhero Identity_ and _Secret Identity_. Before the start of each day, the superhero can tell the Mods which identity they want to be on the following day. Mods will use a default of _Secret Identity_ unless told otherwise.

**Investigations:** While in _Secret Identity_, the superhero may visit murder sites and study clues, as if they were an investigator. While in _Superhero Identity_, they may make investigations as if they were an investigator.

**Immunity:** Every time the superhero chooses to be in their _Superhero Identity_, they can also choose one person to be paranoid about. If, on the day that they are in _Superhero Identity_, that person dies, their paranoia activates for the following day. Then, if they are in their _Secret Identity_ the day their paranoia is active, they can respond to all attempts to use "BANG" with "I do not die." Paranoia has no effect on the _Superhero Identity_. 

(ex of immunity: sammyluo, the superhero, PMs the Mods on day 1 that he wants to be in his _Superhero Identity_ day 2, with jakob as his paranoia target. Sometime during day 2, jakob happens to be killed, and sammyluo PMs the mods that he would like to be in his _Secret identity_ the following day. Day 3 comes, and the mafia that killed jakob tries to “BANG” sammyluo, too, but since his paranoia is active, he responds with “I do not die” and outs the silly rascal.)

###Conspiracy Theorist

Before the start of each day, the Conspiracy Theorist may designate up to 15% of the number of players (rounding up) for their conspiracy list. Mods will assume the list is unchanged unless told otherwise. If anyone on their conspiracy list attempts to use "BANG" on them, they may respond with "I do not die" (You have 10 seconds to say this).

###Cynic

Before the start of each day, the Cynic may designate up to 15% of the number of players (rounding up) for their cynic list. Mods will assume the list is unchanged unless told otherwise. If anyone on their cynic list dies while on the list, the Cynic becomes immune to "BANG" the next day.

###Vigilante

Once per game, a vigilante may attempt to kill any player by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "BANG" at least ten seconds after deciding to do so. If the person died and was mafia (including conscript) or serial killer, then the vigilante gains this ability back, but cannot use it again until the following day. If the person does not die for any reason or was town aligned, the Vigilante loses their power for the rest of game. Vigilantes are town aligned, and their goal is for the town to win. 

###Desperado

Once per game, before the start of a day, the Desperado can tell the Mods that they are going Desperado (you can make the request conditional on day-end events, or cancel the request as long as it's not too late). While going Desperado, they gain all of the abilities of an investigator. Additionally, if anyone tries to use "BANG" on a desperado who has "gone desperado", they may respond by saying "I do not die" (You have 10 seconds to say this). After two days of going Desperado, the desperado dies (after the execution, but before day start).

###Gay Knight

At the start of game, each Gay Knight will know the identity of their partner, who is also a Gay Knight. If a Gay Knight dies, then their partner will die at the end of the following day (For example, if the mafia kill a Gay Knight at 6 PM Tuesday, their partner will die at 11 PM Wednesday). Twice per game, if a Gay Knight's partner is dead, they may guess their partner's killer (Note: They don't gather clues and are immune to mafia powers that trick investigators). If they guess correctly, then they are allowed to kill their partner's killer by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "KABOOM." Additionally, if a Gay Knight guesses correctly, they may respond to anyone who tries to use "BANG" on them by saying "I do not die" (You have 10 seconds to say this).

###Innocent Child

The innocent child is allowed to use the phrase "I am an Innocent child and I trust you" in person only. No one else is allowed to use this phrase. The mafia have an ability that allows them to kill innocent children more easily.

##Elected Roles

Players may make petitions to elect a player to an office, or to impeach a player from that office. Any player can sign each petition once. Election petitions for a role cannot exist while anyone is elected to that role. Impeachment petitions for a role cannot exist unless that player is elected to that role. This means that if another player is elected when your petition was aaaalmost ready, you have to throw it out and run from scratch after they die or are impeached. If a petition has the signatures of more than 50% of the living players, then the player who has the petition can use it by pm-ing the Mods the names of the players who signed. There are two elected roles, and a petition must list the name of the role.


###Mayor

The mayor's vote counts as three votes.
Twice per game, the mayor may ask the Mods how many mafia there are (including conscript, but not including serial killers). No mayor may use more than one count the mafia during their regime.
Once per day, they may make a single investigation by asking the Mods "Did X kill Y?" They do not need to collect clues.

###Police Officer

Each day, the police officer may designate up to three players to "watch" the next day. If any of these players die on that day, the police officer gains three clues (distinct from all clues at the murder scene) for that player's death. Once per day, the police officer may make an investigation, as if they were an investigator. You may make other investigations on the same day if you have a role power that allows you to do so. You may share clues between your police officer power and your role power.

Whenever the police officer would use "BANG" on someone, they may always choose to use "KABOOM" instead. If a police officer uses "KABOOM" on someone, all that person's items are destroyed (instead of given to the police officer).

##Items

The Mods, being nice guys, have given some players items at the start of game. If someone who is executed has an item, the Mods give it to a random player in game. Anyone may destroy an item by telling the Mods. Players may transfer items to each other in-person. An item transfer is only valid if both the giver and the recipient are aware of what item is being transferred. **If you give an item to anyone, you must tell the ****Mods****.**

###Medkit: (2 in game)

A player with the Medkit may tell the Mods that they are activating the Medkit. Once they do, the Medkit is destroyed. The Medkit is active as soon as the message is sent until the day ends, the person who used the Medkit may respond to any "BANG" attempts by saying "I do not die." 

###Shovel: (3 in game)

A player with a shovel may use the shovel to find out all role information of any dead player, including whether or not they were conscripted. Once used, a shovel is destroyed.

###Microphone/Receiver: (3 pairs in game)

Each microphone is paired with a receiver. If the player with a microphone is killed with a "BANG," the player with the corresponding receiver is told the identity of the player who killed them. If the player holding the microphone is killed by "KABOOM," the player with the receiver will not be informed that anything happened. It is extra important that players tell the Mods when receivers are transferred between players, and when a player with a microphone is killed by "BANG," be sure to include the fact that you had a mic on you in your death pm to the Mods.

###Taser: (2 in game)

You may write a target's name on a taser. Once written, it cannot be erased. 5 minutes after the target's name has been written on a taser, anyone with the taser who has line-of-sight on the target may say "I TAZE <Name of target>". A target who has been tazed many not make any kills for the remainder of the day (but can make conscriptions). Once used, a taser is destroyed.

###Camera/CCTV: (0 pairs in game)

The camera is paired with a CCTV receiver. The player with the camera may place it in a Mods-approved location. Once the camera is placed, it cannot be moved or removed by anyone. The holder of the CCTV is informed where the camera was placed. If a kill happens in that location, the holder of the CCTV will see who the killer was, unless a "KABOOM" was used, in which case they will be informed that the TV screen has gone blank. Before it is placed, the camera can be traded or destroyed as any other item. 

_Acceptable locations_ are things like: Lobby 7 (which sees anything in the lobby, but nothing in the infinite, right outside the doors, or in buildings 5 and 9) or a specific room or lounge. We'll define limits of exactly what the camera will see with you, these are just examples.

_Unacceptable locations_ are things like: The entire infinite (too large. I'd split it into 3rds), Mass ave, Outside East Campus (too vague - something like a 4' by 4' box outside the Goodale entrance of EC would be fine, though).

##Mafia: (2 mafia in game)

The following powers are all usable by mafia, and can be used in combination with each other.

Mafia typically needs to find someone in person and touch them in order to kill them. Three exceptions are: 

1. If they are in their own private room but their door is open, the mafia can stand in the doorway and say "I kill you one, I kill you two, I kill you three, BANG/KABOOM." They may not interrupt this incant, they may not slam the door in the mafia's face, they may not jump out their window, but they are free to make any communications they want otherwise while the mafia chants.

2. Poisons (see below)

3. Hitman (see below)

###Free Kill: (Once per day)

Each day, any mafia can attempt to kill someone by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "BANG."  This power is shared between all mafia, but it is not used up if the target doesn't die. 

###KABOOM!: (2 uses)

When you attempt to make a kill, you can use this power by saying "KABOOM" instead of "BANG." All of the target's items are destroyed (instead of the killer taking them). A target who is kaboomed dies, no matter what protection they may have. If you are mafia, you cannot "KABOOM" someone whom the mafia have tried to kill earlier that day with "BANG." Kaboom uses will regenerate if they are used on a target with some sort of protection that using a kaboom would circumvent (medkit, microphone, camera, or role powers).

**Note:** Kaboom regeneration after killing someone with a microphone only occurs if the corresponding receiver still exists and is in the hands of a town-aligned player. A similar rule applies for cameras.

###Scheme: (1 use)

A mafia who has not made any kills yet on a day can use this power to make an extra kill. If all mafia have made a kill on a day, then any mafia can use this power to make a kill.

###Poison: (2 uses)

The mafia may use this power to poison a player. At the start of the next day the victim is informed that they have been poisoned. The victim dies forty-eight hours later (after the execution). 


###Set a Trap: (2 traps)

The mafia start the game with 2 set a traps. Once per day, the mafia can set a trap on someone by pm-ing the Mods with a guess about that person's role. If their guess is incorrect, the trap is destroyed. If their guess is correct, an active charge is stored on the target, and a kill on that person by the mafia no longer uses up the daily kill. If someone with an active trap charge on them dies for any reason, the trap charge on that person regenerates.

###Slaughter the Weak: (1 charge)

This power is identical to set a trap, except that slaughter the weak charges can only be used on innocent children.

###Frame a Townsperson: (1 use)

Choose a player X and a player Y. From now on, all investigations asking "Did player X kill player Y?" will return an answer of yes. Note that if W killed Y, an investigation of "Did W kill Y?" will also return an answer of yes.

###Plant Evidence: (1 use)

Choose a player X, and a role and alignment. From now on, all attempts to shovel player X will return the falsified role and alignment.

###Manipulate the Press: (1 use)

You may use this on any previous murder the mafia have committed to convert all the clues at the murder site to dummy clues. Dummy clues will always turn up a negative result. The mafia can also set the location where the kill is announced to have happened.

###Hire a Hitman: (1 use)

Before the start of the day, the mafia may designate a non-player as a hitman. For that day, the hitman may attempt a kill. This uses up the mafia's daily kill. 

###Conscript: (1 use)

Once per game, the mafia may conscript a player by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse." The conscript's goal is now for the mafia to win. The conscript retains any abilities they had before they were conscripted. The conscript can use mafia powers as if they were a member of the mafia. You MAY conscript someone after a failed kill attempt.

###Disarm:

If a player says "BANG" to a mafia, they may say "Disarm." (They have 10 seconds to say this). If they do, then they ask the attempted killer if they are a serial killer. If the attempted killer was a serial killer, then the mafia survives. If they were not a serial killer, then the mafia still dies.

###Don:

Once per game, the mafia can designate one mafia (not a rogue) to be the Don. The Don does not have to be someone who started the game as mafia. When the Don makes a kill, the victim's microphone and any cameras in that area do not work. Additionally, the Don comes up negative if an investigator tries to investigate them for any kill they have made so far while being Don. If two of three consecutive mafia kills are made by the Don (while they are Don), then the mafia loses the Don powers permanently. However, they still come up negative on all kills they made as Don before they lost their Don powers.

###Mafia restrictions:

If 2 consecutive days or 3 cumulative days pass by where any mafia aligned players don't make any kills, town automatically wins.

If the mafia try to kill someone and fail, no mafia can try to kill the same person again on the same day (this is separate from the serial killer's restriction). 


##Serial Killer: (1 serial killer in game)

The serial killers want the mafia to win. Unfortunately, they don't know who the mafia are. The serial killer may attempt to kill any player by tapping them on the shoulder and saying "BANG". If the kill succeeds, or if the serial killer was disarmed, then they can't make another kill until three days later (for example, an attempted kill at 11 am on a Thursday means you cannot make a kill again until after day end on Saturday). The same serial killer may not try to kill the same person twice on the same day.

###Destroy Evidence: (Once per kill scene per serial killer)

Each serial killer can visit each murder scene once, and destroy one of the clues located there. All investigators that visit the scene will find one fewer clue there. Each serial killer can check once per hour how many clues remain at a murder scene.

The mafia are allowed to give anyone they want mafia den access.

###Serial Killer restrictions:

A serial killer must make a kill within the first three days of game, or else they die of bloodlust. After their first kill, if 2 cumulative days pass by where the serial killer could have made a kill but did not, the serial killer dies of bloodlust.

If the serial killer tries to kill someone and fails, they cannot try to kill the same person again on the same day (this is separate from the mafia's restriction).
